2. preproccess the data - data cleaning and formatting.
3. user to location, ECT/EES/Third-Party/Other?,  mapping.
4. user to role(Example: legal), mapping. // maybe its already implemented inside the model.
6. Introduction & Problem Formulation in the paper.
7. Read academic articles on the topics - Related Work in the paper. 
    8. content analysis - 2+ methods we want to implement. decide on the method.
    9. topic analysis - a method we want to implement. - decide on the method. 
9. start writing the EDA section of the paper.
10. Add readme file to the project.
11. decide on a splitting method for the email body. - for chain email. (maybe only for fowarding mails.)

Maor:
10. Add readme file to the project.
9. start writing the EDA section of the paper.
8. content analysis - 2+ methods we want to implement. decide on the method. (Cons/Pros for several methods, later will choose based on that)
11. decide on a splitting method for the email body. - for chain email. (maybe only for fowarding mails.)

later:
1. contextual analysis - a method we want to implement. - decide on the method.
2. maybe classify users with a model.
3. API to update the data using the user information.
